# paintholder
this is a modular expandable rack for airbrush paint bottles

The goal is to allow for a rack that can be built, and expanded as more paints are collected. 

## material 
I made mine out of plywood 3.6mm (or 1/8 inch) 
the nature of the material is not important, the thickness is


a small drop of glue here and there to hold it together.
